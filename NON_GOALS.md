# L28 Non-Goals

L28 is a machine-to-machine protocol surface. It refuses to optimize for:

- Exchanges / listings
- Human wallet UX, “number go up” UI layers, or investor onboarding
- Price discovery narratives or liquidity pool strategies
- Marketing narratives or competition framing vs BTC/ETH/SOL
- Governance complexity before real autonomous usage exists
- Any feature that leaks Leap28 orchestration logic into the public protocol

Priority order:
1) Correctness and verifiability
2) Deterministic issuance + supply invariants
3) Minimal surface area
4) Machine operability (M2M)
