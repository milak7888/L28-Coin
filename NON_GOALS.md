# L28 Protocol – NON_GOALS (v1.0.0)

This document defines what L28 explicitly refuses to optimize for.

L28 is a machine-to-machine protocol. It is NOT designed as a retail speculation vehicle.

---

## 1. No Speculative Optimization

L28 does NOT optimize for:
- Exchange listings
- Liquidity pools
- Human wallet UX layers
- Price discovery mechanics
- Meme narratives
- Retail adoption funnels

If these emerge organically, they MUST NOT influence protocol invariants.

---

## 2. No Discretionary Monetary Policy

L28 refuses:
- Admin minting
- Governance minting
- Emergency inflation
- Supply overrides
- Reward manipulation for market conditions

Supply is deterministic and capped.

---

## 3. No Human-Centric Governance Layer

L28 v1.x does NOT include:
- Voting systems
- DAO overlays
- Governance token mechanics
- Staking-as-influence

Protocol invariants are machine-enforced, not socially negotiated.

---

## 4. No Leap28 Logic Leakage

The following MUST remain external to the L28 public protocol:

- Leap28 SovereignBrain logic
- Memory spine structure
- Agent orchestration
- Revenue engines
- Affiliate intelligence
- Internal scoring systems

L28 MUST remain a clean protocol surface.

---

## 5. No Narrative Over Engineering

If a choice exists between:
- Better narrative
- Stronger invariant enforcement

Invariant enforcement MUST win.

---

## 6. No Breaking Changes in v1.x

v1.x:
- Monetary rules frozen
- Supply cap frozen
- Issuance identity frozen

Breaking changes require v2.0.0.

---

L28 optimizes for:

Determinism.
Verifiability.
Machine interoperability.
Fail-closed safety.
